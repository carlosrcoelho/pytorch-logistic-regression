Logistic Regression - PyTorch

Logistic Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. In PyTorch, it's relatively straightforward to implement a logistic regression model using the available libraries and tools.
I'll present a simple straightforward example of how to do it. This is me learning Pytorch, hope you enjoy and learn a bit from it.
